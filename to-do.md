# Cash for Gold - Modern Futuristic Website Development Plan

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture
- [ ] Set up file structure (HTML, CSS, JS, assets directories).
- [ ] Establish futuristic typography (e.g., Space Grotesk, Orbitron, or clean Sans-Serif like Inter).
- [ ] Configure baseline CSS variables for themes (Deep Space Black backgrounds, Neon Gold accents).

## 🎨 Phase 2: Futuristic Design System
- [ ] Define Color Palette: Deep blacks (`#050505`), sleek dark grays, and striking gold (`#FFD700` variants) with glowing effects.
- [ ] Implement UI Elements: Glassmorphism panels, glowing borders, smooth hover animations (Awwwards style).
- [ ] Create layout grid emphasizing whitespace, large typography, and immersive visuals.

## 🧭 Phase 3: Core UI & Navigation
- [ ] Build responsive, sticky navigation bar with a futuristic logo.
- [ ] Implement off-canvas or full-screen menu for mobile.
- [ ] Add subtle enter-animations for page load (like a digital "boot-up" sequence).

## ✨ Phase 4: Dynamic Features & Interactive Sections
- [ ] **Hero Section**: High-impact scroll-triggered visual or interactive 3D gold elements.
- [ ] **Interactive Valuation Tool**: A sleek, futuristic calculator where users enter gold weight/karat to see a real-time, animated price estimate.
- [ ] **"How it Works" Flow**: Step-by-step animated guide (Request Kit -> Send Gold -> Get Paid).
- [ ] **Trust & Security Panel**: Glowing badges and high-tech security visual cues to build trust.
- [ ] **Real-time Price Ticker**: A digital ticker showing live or simulated gold market prices.

## 🖼️ Phase 5: Asset Generation & Integration
- [ ] Generate modern/futuristic gold, jewelry, and high-tech UI assets using **Nano Banana** image generation.
- [ ] Edit and optimize generated images.
- [ ] Integrate images into the canvas/hero and feature sections.

## 🛠️ Phase 6: Polish & Launch
- [ ] Refine all transition and scroll animations (using GSAP or Vanilla CSS/JS observer).
- [ ] Ensure perfect responsive behavior across devices.
- [ ] Final performance optimizations and contrast checks.
